# Minimum Number Of Squares
# Send Feedback
# A number can always be represented as a sum of squares of other numbers. Note that 1 is a square and we can always break a number as [(1 * 1) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) + â€¦]. Given a number n, find the minimum number of squares that sum to n.
# Input format:
#  The first and only line of input contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 10000)
# Constraints:
#  Time Limit: 1 seconds
# Output format:
# The first and only line of output contains the minimum number if squares that sum to n.
# Sample Test Cases:
# Sample Input 1:
# 100
# Sample Output 1:
# 1
# Explanation:
# We can write 100 as 10^2 also, 100 can be written as (5^2) + (5^2) + (5^2) + (5^2), but this representation requires 4 squares. So, in this case, the expected answer would be 1, that is, 10^2.
